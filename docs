# Project Analysis: Plantation Management System (KNOWEB EstateIQ)

## 1. Project Overview
**What is this?**
A **SaaS-based Plantation Management System** (ERP) designed to digitize the entire operation of tea, rubber, and cinnamon estates. It replaces manual books with a modern digital platform.

**Who is it for?**
- **Field Officers**: Mobile-first users who record daily attendance (Muster), Harvest yields, and request stock.
- **Managers**: Desktop users who plan work programs, approve requests, and analyze financial/crop performance.
- **Super Admin**: The SaaS vendor managing subscriptions for multiple estates.

**Key Features**:
- **Digital Muster**: Drag-and-drop worker assignment (Visual Attendance).
- **Crop Book**: Real-time tracking of daily harvest vs. budget.
- **Inventory Control**: Request -> Approve -> Issue workflow.
- **Cost Analysis**: Calculating Cost-Per-Kilo in real-time.
- **AI "Supervisor"**: Automated recommendations based on weather and historical data.

## 2. Technical Architecure

### Frontend (User Interface)
- **Tech**: React 18+ (TypeScript), Material UI / Ant Design.
- **Style**: Data-dense grids, "Green/White" branding, Tabular layouts for financial data.
- **Key Modules**:
    - **Muster Interface**: Drag-and-drop worker allocation.
    - **Dashboard**: High-density KPI tables (Yield, Cost, Balance).
    - **Chat**: Internal messaging system for approvals/correspondence.

### Backend (Infrastructure)
- **Tech**: Java Spring Boot 3.x (Microservices).
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (Multi-Tenant schema with `tenant_id`).
- **Services**:
    - `Identity Service`: Auth & User Roles.
    - `Operations Service`: Muster, Harvest, Work Program.
    - `Inventory Service`: Stock, Orders, Suppliers.
    - `Finance Service`: Payroll calculations, Cost analysis.
- **AI Core**: Python/LangChain service for predictive staffing and weather alerts.

## 3. Implementation Roadmap (How we will build it)

We will follow a **Backend-First** approach to ensure the complex data relationships are solid before building the UI.

### Phase 1: Foundation & Backend Core
1.  **Project Scaffolding**: Create the Spring Boot Microservices structure.
2.  **Database Implementation**: Execute the `plantation_db_schema.sql` and create Java Entities.
3.  **API Development**: Build REST APIs for:
    - User Authentication (Login).
    - Master Data (Divisions, Fields, Workers).
    - Operations (Muster submission, Harvest recording).

### Phase 2: Frontend "Shell" & Basic Forms
1.  **React Setup**: Initialize the project with the specific Green/White theme.
2.  **Authentication UI**: Build the Login Screen (as seen in Mockup 2).
3.  **Navigation**: Implement the Sidebar for Field Officers vs Managers.

### Phase 3: Complex Modules (The "Grids")
1.  **Digital Muster**: Build the interactive worker assignment screen (Mockup 3).
2.  **Crop Book**: Build the large data table for daily yield tracking (Mockup 2, Batch 3).
3.  **Financials**: Implement the Real-time Cost Analysis view.

### Phase 4: AI & Polish
1.  **AI Integration**: Connect Weather API and build the "Supervisor Agent".
2.  **Chat System**: Implement the Correspondence module.

## 4. Next Step
**Action**: Begin **Phase 1: Foundation**.
**Task**: Scaffold the Spring Boot Project and set up the PostgreSQL database connection using the provided schema.
